## Intro

- This is a fork from Klein Norbert's Taskmarks (Little helper for teams to navigate through files. https://github.com/norbertK/taskmarks)

# Taskmarks

VSCode Extension - Persist bookmarks for different tasks.

On big projects, coming back to a topic that I did not touch for some time, I often need time to 'find the right places'. Taskmarks makes it possible to keep those old bookmarks, and go back to them, whenever I need them.

New topic - just add a new Task and keep them forever.

Or copy a Task and share it with your co-workers. Or create a new one, to tell him or her: 'Please look here and here. Do we have a problem? / Could you please ...'
