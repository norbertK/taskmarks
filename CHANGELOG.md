## [Unreleased - Ideas - not ideal]

- rename Task
- disable taskbar display (and perhaps other things) in settings
- sort marks
- make little demo, how to work with taskmarks
- find better shortcuts and make them work outside the edit mode (eg 'goto next' or 'Select Active Task' should work always)
